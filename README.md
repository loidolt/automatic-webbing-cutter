## General Info
These files are provided as-is, the model was assembled and tested to be working properly, and the firmware was tested separately, but unfortunately, the project was never finished with the two parts combined.

Providing this design in the hope that it can help someone else with a future project. If you have any questions I will do my best to provide any help I can.
